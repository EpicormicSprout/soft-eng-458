General Workflow for Scraping and Fixing the Abstracts.
1. Turn excel or google sheet into a CSV, making sure there are urls with a column header titled “URL”. 
2. Move the CSV file into a folder with scrape_abstract.py.
3. Copy and paste the CSV title into INPUT_CSV, and change OUTPUT_CSV to whatever you want the new CSV file to be called.
4. Run the script with “python3 scrape_abstracts.py” inside a terminal window
   1. If the libraries imported are not on your machine, then install them with 
      1. “python3 -m pip install library_name
5. Once the script is running, leave the computer on until the script finishes.
6. After completion you will be given a new CSV file with a column added titled ‘Abstract’. You can then read through it with excel, google sheets or any other software that can read CSVs.
   1. There will most likely be a bunch of rows indicating that there was an error with reading the URL
7. Now is the time to manually find any incomplete abstracts, and fix them by copy and pasting the correct one into that cell.
   1. The most common ways to identify them are using CTRL+F with “...” as the search term or if the abstract stops mid sentence.
